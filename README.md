Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing monthly sales trends by calculating total revenue and number of orders over time. The goal is to understand how business performance changes across months and years based on order data.

Dataset Used:
The dataset contains order details including:
- Order date
- Order ID
- Product ID
- Quantity ordered
- Amount (sales revenue)

All analysis was based on this data to summarize performance month-wise.

Technologies:
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite

Key Concepts Covered:
- Data grouping by year and month to identify trends
- Summation of revenue to track monthly income
- Counting unique orders to measure sales volume
- Sorting to view trends in chronological order

Why I Use a SQL View in This Task?

A view is like a virtual table that stores a SQL query result. It helps in:

1. Reusability
2. Simplified Reporting
3. Performance Optimization
4. Data Abstraction
5. Cleaner Code
